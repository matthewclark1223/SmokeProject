abstract: Humans must adapt to our increasingly variable and hazardous climate. Worsening wildfire smoke events in the American West represent a serious risk to human health and also a pertinent test-case for individual climate adaptation generally. Here we aggregate data on ambient smoke and recreational visitation in 32 U.S. national parks from 1980 - 2019 to test for observable adaptation to worsening wildfire smoke. We develop a series of breakpoint models to allow for threshold effects in recreational response. These models demonstrate that even when dangerous levels of smoke are present, individuals are failing to limit outdoor recreation. Future research may further our understanding of individual-level climate adaptation by focusing on alternative hazards or finer time series.

# Introduction
Climate change has already begun to dramatically change the social-ecological landscapes in which humans have learned to operate [@IPCC]. All levels of human society must urgently adapt to these new realities if we are to continue to thrive over the coming millenia [@IPCC]. As a society, we are aware of this, but still are failing to respond adequately [@steg_limiting_2018]. Even when adaptive strategies and their benefits are known, we do not demonstrate adaptive behaviors [@van_valkengoed_meta-analyses_2019]. While research has shown that extreme events tend to spur climate adaptation at the government level, less is known about how individuals are reacting and possibly adapting to a changing climate [@bierbaum_comprehensive_2013; @berrang-ford_tracking_2019; @berrang-ford_are_2011]. 

A particularly salient environmental effect of climate change in the United States is the increasing wildfire frequency and severity over the last 40 years, primarily in the American West [@kitzberger_contingent_2007; @westerling_increasing_2016]. As climate change accounts for approximately half of the increase in burned area during this time, fires are expected to worsen over the next 40 years as the climate continues to warm [@westerling_increasing_2016; @abatzoglou_impact_2016; @yue_ensemble_2013; @wuebbles_climate_2017; @harvey_human-caused_2016; @peterson_new_2003; @barbero_climate_2015]. Accompanying the increase in wildfires in the American West, is a projected increase in wildfire smoke [@schroeder_validation_2008]. Fire-prone areas may experience a two-fold increase in wildfire smoke by 2100 [@hurteau_projected_2014].

Wildfire smoke is a complex mixture of gasses aerated by biomass combustion across the landscape [@naeher_woodsmoke_2007]. While many of these compounds have been shown to cause health problems in humans, organic carbon and black carbon particulate matter less than 2.5 $\mu$m in diameter ($\text{PM}_{2.5}$) is particularly harmful to human health [@deryugina_mortality_2019]. $\text{PM}_{2.5}$ causes between 260,000 - 600,000 global deaths annually and significantly increases community mortality even under acute exposure [@johnston_fay_h_estimated_2012; @naeher_woodsmoke_2007; @kloog_long-_2013].

In some regions of the American West, wildfires now account for 50% of all atmospheric $\text{PM}_{2.5}$, compared to less than 20% in 2010 [@burke_changing_2021]. As any level of ambient $\text{PM}_{2.5}$ increases community morbidity, public health agencies increasingly call for individuals to limit outdoor recreational behavior when wildfire smoke is present [@cascio_wildland_2018; @reid_colleen_e_critical_2016; @oneill_summary_2013].

Recent literature reviews on recreational behavior have found a dearth of research describing how individuals respond to low air quality, as well as research which gives predictions for how climate change will affect the recreation landscape [@otoole_climate_2019;@zajchowski_air_2019-1]. Additionally, a survey of federal land managers indicated that decision makers in areas such as national parks feel that they have a shortage of information describing how air quality affects the recreational behavior of their visitors [@zajchowski_air_2019]. 

It is of particular importance to understand how individuals are responding to wildfire smoke because it may provide a test case for how individuals will adapt to climate change generally. This article uses ambient smoke and visitation data collected from national parks in the Western and Intermountain United States from 1980-2019 to answer whether individuals are adapting their recreation behavior in response to increasing wildfire smoke. We hypothesize that the effect of ambient smoke on national park visitation may be nonlinear, only showing a measurable impact in the upper ranges of the observed smoke values. Threshold effects such as this are common in ecology and human behavioral sciences [@muradian2001ecological; @huggett2005concept; @macy1991chains]. Toms & Lesperance [-@toms2003piecewise] show that breakpoint models are an effective tool to account for these thresholds and gather inference about the effects of predictors before and after in natural systems. Here we develop a series of three hierarchical breakpoint models to determine if threshold effects are present in national park visitation response to ambient smoke and if so, what the effect of smoke is on visitation to national parks in the American West. The case study presented here aims to provide insights as to the overall trajectory of realized climate adaptation on the individual level. 

# Methods
## Data collection

### Visitation data
Visitation data were obtained on the monthly scale through the [National Park Service Visitor Use Statistics Portal](https://irma.nps.gov/STATS/). These data are generally collected via car counters, permit information, and concessionaire reporting. Methods of collection vary from park to park. Unit specific information can be found on the National Park Service Visitor Use Statistics Portal. Although collection methods are inconsistent across the sample, all data was taken as reported. We retrieved monthly data for all national park units in the Intermountain and Pacific West regions for years 1980 through 2019. To reduce issues regarding park seasonality, we then subset our data to only the three month high season associated with each park. For example, only Summer (June, July, Aug) data was used for Yellowstone National Park.

## Analyses

### Modeling
We first account for underlying change in national park visitation from 1980-2019 by developing a temporal autoregressive model which we validate and build upon to answer our main research question. This baseline autoregressive model uses the visitation data from the three previous years to predict the visitation to a given park in a given month. This formulation of an autoregressive model is commonly referred to as an AR(*k*) model, with this particular instance holding that *k* = 3 [@standev2021stancore]. We chose a *k* of 3 as the added within-sample predictive value of increasing *k* diminished considerably for any greater value. 

We formulated this baseline autoregressive model using a Bayesian hierarchical framework. This approach is appropriate here as it allows us to account between park variation in visitation trends while acknowledging the interconnectedness of these trends through partial pooling [@statrethinkingbook]. For each park ($j$) we estimate a parameter value ($\bm{\nu1...k}$) representing the trend in visitation from one, two, and three years prior ($t-1,2,...k$), to the month we are estimating ($i$). Finally, we estimate both global ($\alpha0$) and park specific ($\bm{\beta0}_{j}$) intercepts to yield equation 1 below. We modeled these data using a negative binomial distribution to allow us to estimate an overdispersion parameter ($\phi$) rather than assuming the dispersion is equal to the mean.  


$$ y_{ij} \sim NegBinom(\mu_{ij},\phi) $$

\begin{equation}
\text{log}(\mu_{ij}) = 
\alpha0+\bm{\beta0}_{j}+\bm{\nu1}_{j}*\text{vis}_{i,t-1}+ \\
\bm{\nu2}_{j}*\text{vis}_{i,t-2}+\bm{\nu3}_{j}*\text{vis}_{i,t-3}  
\end{equation}

$$\bm{\beta0}_{j} \sim Norm(0,\sigma)$$

After validating that the model above captures the baseline trends in national park visitation from 1980-2019, we built upon it to estimate if a critical threshold for visitation response to wildfire smoke exists in these data and if so, what the impact of wildfire smoke is on visitation post-threshold. To do this, we developed a series of three breakpoint models, allowing for three increasingly extreme breakpoints (i.e. critical thresholds). We standardized these smoke data, and thus the thresholds as well, by dividing by two standard deviations following the recommendation made by Gelman [-@gelman2008scaling]. A threshold of 1.0 can then be interpreted as two standard deviations above the mean value of smoke in the data. A visual comparison of the observed actual smoke values and standardized values can be seen in Fig. 1. 

As shown conceptually in Fig. 2, we estimated the effect of smoke on visitation before ($\bm{\beta1}$) and after ($\bm{\beta2}$) each breakpoint (BP). Just as with the autoregressive terms, we estimated unique parameter values for each park ($j$) in a hierarchical framework. The complete model used for each of the three breakpoint values is then as seen in equation 2.   



![image alt text](../Figures/bpplot2.png)

$$ y_{ij} \sim NegBinom(\mu_{ij},\phi) $$

\begin{equation}
\text{log}(\mu_{ij}) = 
\begin{cases} 
\alpha0+\bm{\beta0}_{j}+\bm{\beta1}_{j}*\text{smoke}_{i}+\bm{\nu1}_{j}*\text{vis}_{i,t-1}+ \\
\bm{\nu2}_{j}*\text{vis}_{i,t-2}+\bm{\nu3}_{j}*\text{vis}_{i,t-3} & \text{if } \text{smoke}_{i} < \text{BP} \\ \\
\beta0+\bm{\beta0}_{j}+\bm{\beta1}_{j}*\text{BP}+(\text{smoke}_{i}-\text{BP})*\bm{\beta2}_{j}+  \\ \bm{\nu1}_{j}*\text{vis}_{i,t-1}+\bm{\nu2}_{j}*\text{vis}_{i,t-2}+\bm{\nu3}_{j}*\text{vis}_{i,t-3}        & \text{if } \text{smoke}_{i} \geq \text{BP}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

$$\bm{\beta0}_{j} \sim Norm(0,\sigma)$$

Following the recommendation given by Gelman et al. [-@gelman2008weakly] for producing stable, conservative estimates, we specified long-tailed regularizing priors for all autoregressive terms, the global intercept value, and the overdispersion parameter. We used normally distributed regularizing priors for estimating the variance parameter ($\sigma$) and the pre and post-breakpoint smoke effects to allow for more efficient sampling while generative within-sample predictions at high smoke values.  

### Validation
Due to the considerable computational time (about 1 day) needed to run the program described above, we validated the results of both the autoregressive-only and breakpoint models using within-sample posterior predictive checks. All models were first inspected to ensure adequate mixing of Markov chains, $\hat{R}$ values below 1.05 for all parameter estimates, and the absence of divergent transitions after warm up.  

We examined the within-sample predictive capacity of the autoregressive only model to be sure we adequately accounted for baseline changes in visitation before building on this model to test for the effects of smoke on visitation. This baseline model allowed us to account for approximately 40% of all variation in the data, with the bulk of the error occurring when actual visitation was very high or very low (Fig 3).

# Results
While some between-park variation exists, our overall study shows no evidence for recreational visitor response to wildfire smoke in national parks in the American West. Figures 4 and 5 show the parameter estimates for the pre and post breakpoint smoke effects respectively. In all three breakpoint models, only two parks have 90% credible intervals that do not overlap zero for slope 1, both of which have opposite signs (Fig. 4). This trend is paralleled for slope 2 in the two lower breakpoint models and all 90% credibility intervals overlap 0 for slope 2 in the model with the most extreme breakpoint (Fig. 5). 

Intuitively, the within-sample $R^2$ increases only slightly when accounting for smoke effects, from 0.40 to 0.41 compared to the autoregressive only model. This suggests that ambient smoke in national parks in the American West is not driving any measurable changes in visitation even at sustained and dangerous levels. We then conclude that visitors are not altering recreation behavior in response to smoke and therefore no critical threshold for adaptation is detectable in these data.

# Discussion
Given the data available to us, we detect no visitor adaptation to increasing wildfire smoke in national parks in the American West. This result is troubling both immediately and in the long-term. As discussed above, $\text{PM}_{2.5}$ significantly increases community morbidity even under acute exposure. In concert with showing no overall trends in behavioral adaptation, these data provide specific instances of historic smoke events where visitation did not deviate from normal.  

The highly variable nature of wildfires, their relationship to climate change, and the great distances that smoke can travel during and after wildfire events make it difficult for individuals to plan around smoke events [@dombeck_wildfire_2004; @collins_regional_2006]. In conjunction, U.S. national parks draw a great number of non-local visitors, many of whom are coming from other states or countries and are likely visiting for the first time [@schuett2010visits]. We speculate that these visitors are less likely to change their plans due to wildfire smoke than individuals recreating locally or repeatedly in one location. We propose that these unique features of national parks and wildfire smoke make visitors particularly unable to adapt to changing climatic conditions. 

Based on our findings here, we put forward that a regional or national level policy limiting visitation during dangerous smoke events may be necessary to protect would-be visitors to U.S. national parks [@rai_policy_2020]. Presently, there is considerable variation in the way states react and plan for climate change and associated hazards [@hu_evaluating_2018].

## Limitations and fututre research

A key limitation of this study is the lack of availability of fine scale visitation data to US national parks. Daily visitation data would allow us to identify a more complete picture of if and how visitors respond to smoke events day to day. Current data at the monthly scale allows us to investigate the big picture trends in visitor behavior, but future research would benefit greatly from daily count data. It is possible that individuals postpone visits to national parks by days or weeks when smoke is present, behavior which our current study would be unable to capture. 

It is also possible that this trend would not be observed for recreation on all public lands or for all climate change-induced hazards. Another path for future research might investigate if the trend shown here holds for other public lands with different visitor profiles and for other hazards.

# Conclusion 
The results presented here indicate that individuals are not modifying their behavior to adapt to worsening wildfire smoke events. It is unclear if this finding is representative of individual climate adaptation generally or is unique to this system. Regardless of the generality of our findings, this study has specific implications for management of U.S. national parks. Future research may confirm or negate the trend shown here in individual climate adaptation broadly. This will have considerable implications for the future of all communities living with climate-induced hazards.
