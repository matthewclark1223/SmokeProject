	abstract = {Climate change will affect not only natural and cultural resources within protected areas but also tourism and visitation patterns. The U.S. National Park Service systematically collects data regarding its 270+ million annual recreation visits, and therefore provides an opportunity to examine how human visitation may respond to climate change from the tropics to the polar regions. To assess the relationship between climate and park visitation, we evaluated historical monthly mean air temperature and visitation data (1979–2013) at 340 parks and projected potential future visitation (2041–2060) based on two warming-climate scenarios and two visitation-growth scenarios. For the entire park system a third-order polynomial temperature model explained 69\% of the variation in historical visitation trends. Visitation generally increased with increasing average monthly temperature, but decreased strongly with temperatures {\textgreater} 25°C. Linear to polynomial monthly temperature models also explained historical visitation at individual parks (R2 0.12-0.99, mean = 0.79, median = 0.87). Future visitation at almost all parks (95\%) may change based on historical temperature, historical visitation, and future temperature projections. Warming-mediated increases in potential visitation are projected for most months in most parks (67–77\% of months; range across future scenarios), resulting in future increases in total annual visits across the park system (8–23\%) and expansion of the visitation season at individual parks (13–31 days). Although very warm months at some parks may see decreases in future visitation, this potential change represents a relatively small proportion of visitation across the national park system. A changing climate is likely to have cascading and complex effects on protected area visitation, management, and local economies. Results suggest that protected areas and neighboring communities that develop adaptation strategies for these changes may be able to both capitalize on opportunities and minimize detriment related to changing visitation.},

	abstract = {Following a strong El Niño, the climate of the North Pacific underwent a rapid and striking transition in late 1998. Upwelling-favorable winds strengthened over the California Current ({CC}), and winds weakened in the Gulf of Alaska ({GOA}). Coastal waters of the {CC} and {GOA} cooled by several degrees, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation ({PDO}) reversed sign and remained negative through summer 2002. Zooplankton biomass in the northern {CC} doubled and switched from warm to cold water species dominance, coho and chinook salmon stocks rebounded, and anchovy and osmeriids increased. Persistent changes in atmosphere and upper ocean fields and ecosystem structure suggest a climate regime shift has occurred, similar (opposite) to shifts observed in 1947 (1925 and 1976). If the 1998 regime shift in the northern {CC} is completely analogous to earlier shifts, then ecosystem structure should have changed in the {GOA}. Recent surveys indicate this ecosystem has transformed as well.},

	abstract = {Background: Forest, grass, and peat fires release approximately 2 petagrams of carbon into the atmosphere each year, influencing weather, climate, and air quality.Objective: We estimated the annual global mortality attributable to landscape fire smoke ({LFS}).Methods: Daily and annual exposure to particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter ({PM}2.5) from fire emissions was estimated globally for 1997 through 2006 by combining outputs from a chemical transport model with satellite-based observations of aerosol optical depth. In World Health Organization ({WHO}) subregions classified as sporadically affected, the daily burden of mortality was estimated using previously published concentration–response coefficients for the association between short-term elevations in {PM}2.5 from {LFS} (contrasted with 0 μg/m3 from {LFS}) and all-cause mortality. In subregions classified as chronically affected, the annual burden of mortality was estimated using the American Cancer Society study coefficient for the association between long-term {PM}2.5 exposure and all-cause mortality. The annual average {PM}2.5 estimates were contrasted with theoretical minimum (counterfactual) concentrations in each chronically affected subregion. Sensitivity of mortality estimates to different exposure assessments, counterfactual estimates, and concentration–response functions was evaluated. Strong La Niña and El Niño years were compared to assess the influence of interannual climatic variability.Results: Our principal estimate for the average mortality attributable to {LFS} exposure was 339,000 deaths annually. In sensitivity analyses the interquartile range of all tested estimates was 260,000–600,000. The regions most affected were sub-Saharan Africa (157,000) and Southeast Asia (110,000). Estimated annual mortality during La Niña was 262,000, compared with 532,000 during El Niño.Conclusions: Fire emissions are an important contributor to global mortality. Adverse health outcomes associated with {LFS} could be substantially reduced by curtailing burning of tropical rainforests, which rarely burn naturally. The large estimated influence of El Niño suggests a relationship between climate and the burden of mortality attributable to {LFS}.},

	abstract = {Widespread synchronous wildfires driven by climatic variation, such as those that swept western North America during 1996, 2000, and 2002, can result in major environmental and societal impacts. Understanding relationships between continental-scale patterns of drought and modes of sea surface temperatures ({SSTs}) such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation ({ENSO}), Pacific Decadal Oscillation ({PDO}), and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation ({AMO}) may explain how interannual to multidecadal variability in {SSTs} drives fire at continental scales. We used local wildfire chronologies reconstructed from fire scars on tree rings across western North America and independent reconstructions of {SST} developed from tree-ring widths at other sites to examine the relationships of multicentury patterns of climate and fire synchrony. From 33,039 annually resolved fire-scar dates at 238 sites (the largest paleofire record yet assembled), we examined forest fires at regional and subcontinental scales. Since 1550 {CE}, drought and forest fires covaried across the West, but in a manner contingent on {SST} modes. During certain phases of {ENSO} and {PDO}, fire was synchronous within broad subregions and sometimes asynchronous among those regions. In contrast, fires were most commonly synchronous across the West during warm phases of the {AMO}. {ENSO} and {PDO} were the main drivers of high-frequency variation in fire (interannual to decadal), whereas the {AMO} conditionally changed the strength and spatial influence of {ENSO} and {PDO} on wildfire occurrence at multidecadal scales. A current warming trend in {AMO} suggests that we may expect an increase in widespread, synchronous fires across the western U.S. in coming decades.},

	shorttitle = {Increasing western {US} forest wildfire activity},
	abstract = {Prior work shows western {US} forest wildfire activity increased abruptly in the mid-1980s. Large forest wildfires and areas burned in them have continued to increase over recent decades, with most of the increase in lightning-ignited fires. Northern {US} Rockies forests dominated early increases in wildfire activity, and still contributed 50\% of the increase in large fires over the last decade. However, the percentage growth in wildfire activity in Pacific northwestern and southwestern {US} forests has rapidly increased over the last two decades. Wildfire numbers and burned area are also increasing in non-forest vegetation types. Wildfire activity appears strongly associated with warming and earlier spring snowmelt. Analysis of the drivers of forest wildfire sensitivity to changes in the timing of spring demonstrates that forests at elevations where the historical mean snow-free season ranged between two and four months, with relatively high cumulative warm-season actual evapotranspiration, have been most affected. Increases in large wildfires associated with earlier spring snowmelt scale exponentially with changes in moisture deficit, and moisture deficit changes can explain most of the spatial variability in forest wildfire regime response to the timing of spring.This article is part of the themed issue ‘The interaction of fire and mankind’.},

Recent work has explored the role of visitation to parks and protected areas in providing health and well-being benefits. This conceptual paper identifies the state-of-the-art research findings on this issue from an interdisciplinary perspective. The results reveal increasing understanding of the positive relationships between park and protected area visitation and the associated health and well-being benefits to the visitors. It also establishes the need for better collaboration between park and protected area and health institutions, which will require new and innovative transdisciplinary partnerships in order to better understand salient issues, realign common interests where appropriate, and effectively integrate empirical evidence into relevant policy, planning and management. Recommendations are made for specific knowledge user groups, such as policy makers, social and health professionals, protected areas professionals, and researchers, with the ultimate objective of better linking human health and well-being and protected areas policies to enhance delivery mechanisms for health promotion activities.
Management Implications

Visitation has a key role in existing national parks, but also in assessing the social and economic impacts of new parks. This study examined how the natural characteristics of a park, the recreation facilities and services inside a park and tourist services in surrounding communities, as well as the park's location in relation to the population, are associated with the number of visits. Regression modelling was used to analyse the visitation to thirty-five national parks in Finland. The results demonstrated that recreation opportunities, the number of biotopes, the provision of trails and the park's age increase the number of visits, while the park location in relation to the population only has a significant effect in southern Finland. The results imply the dual role of national parks as resource-based destinations if the natural characteristics are outstanding, but also as more user-oriented areas fulfilling recreation needs in the most populated parts of the country.},

This study used regression tree and random forest analysis on global data for various climatic and human variables to establish their relative importance. The main interactions found at the global scale also apply regionally: greatest wildfire burned area is associated with high temperature ({\textgreater}28°C), intermediate annual rainfall (350–1100mm), and prolonged dry periods (which varies by region). However, the regions of highest fire incidence do not show clear and systematic behaviour. Thresholds seen in the regression tree split conditions vary, as do the interplay between climatic and anthropogenic variables, so challenges remain in developing robust predictive insight for the most wildfire-threatened regions. Anthropogenic activities alter the spatial extent of wildfires. Gross domestic product ({GDP}) density is the most important human predictor variable at the regional scale, and burned area is always greater when {GDP} density is minimised. South America is identified as a region of concern, as anthropogenic factors (notably land conversions) outweigh climatic drivers of wildfire burned area.},

Wildfires that escape initial suppression often expand into large, high-intensity summer blazes. Lost is the legacy of smaller fires that likely burned outside extreme weather and fuel conditions and resulted in less severe impacts. Despite the recognized need for modifications to existing policies and practices, resource agencies have been slow to respond. The spread of exotic species, climate change, and increasing human development in wildlands further complicates the issue. New policies are needed that integrate social and ecological needs across administrative boundaries and broad landscapes. These policies should promote a continuum of treatments with active management and reduction of fuel hazard in wildland-urban interface zones and reintroduction of fire in wildlands. Management goals should focus on restoration of the long-term ecological health of the land. Projects that reduce fuel loads but compromise the integrity of soil, water supplies, or watersheds will do more harm than good in the long run. Despite significant ecological concerns, learning to live with fire remains primarily a social issue that will require greater political leadership, agency innovation, public involvement, and community responsibility.},

	shorttitle = {Woodsmoke Health Effects},
	abstract = {The sentiment that woodsmoke, being a natural substance, must be benign to humans is still sometimes heard. It is now well established, however, that wood-burning stoves and fireplaces as well as wildland and agricultural fires emit significant quantities of known health-damaging pollutants, including several carcinogenic compounds. Two of the principal gaseous pollutants in woodsmoke, {CO} and {NOx}, add to the atmospheric levels of these regulated gases emitted by other combustion sources. Health impacts of exposures to these gases and some of the other woodsmoke constituents (e.g., benzene) are well characterized in thousands of publications. As these gases are indistinguishable no matter where they come from, there is no urgent need to examine their particular health implications in woodsmoke. With this as the backdrop, this review approaches the issue of why woodsmoke may be a special case requiring separate health evaluation through two questions. The first question we address is whether woodsmoke should be regulated and/or managed separately, even though some of its separate constituents are already regulated in many jurisdictions. The second question we address is whether woodsmoke particles pose different levels of risk than other ambient particles of similar size. To address these two key questions, we examine several topics: the chemical and physical nature of woodsmoke; the exposures and epidemiology of smoke from wildland fires and agricultural burning, and related controlled human laboratory exposures to biomass smoke; the epidemiology of outdoor and indoor woodsmoke exposures from residential woodburning in developed countries; and the toxicology of woodsmoke, based on animal exposures and laboratory tests. In addition, a short summary of the exposures and health effects of biomass smoke in developing countries is provided as an additional line of evidence. In the concluding section, we return to the two key issues above to summarize (1) what is currently known about the health effects of inhaled woodsmoke at exposure levels experienced in developed countries, and (2) whether there exists sufficient reason to believe that woodsmoke particles are sufficiently different to warrant separate treatment from other regulated particles. In addition, we provide recommendations for additional woodsmoke research.},

	abstract = {Several U.S. state and tribal agencies and other countries have implemented a methodology developed in the arid intermountain western U.S. where short-term (1- to 3-hr) particulate matter ({PM}) with aerodynamic diameters less than 2.5 µm ({PM}2.5) concentrations are estimated from an observed visual range ({VR}) measurement. This {PM}2.5 concentration estimate is then linked to a public health warning scale to inform the public about potential health impacts from smoke from wildfire. This methodology is often used where monitoring data do not exist (such as many rural areas). This work summarizes the various approaches, highlights the potential for wildfire smoke impact messaging conflicts at state and international borders, and highlights the need to define consistent short-term health impact category breakpoint categories. Is air quality “unhealthy” when 1- to 3-hr {PM}2.5 is ≥ 139 µg/m3 as specified in the Wildfire Smoke, A Guide for Public Health Officials? Or is air quality unhealthy when 1- to 3-hr {PM}2.5 is ≥ 88.6 μg/m3 as specified in the Montana categorizations? This work then examines the relationship between visual range and {PM}2.5 concentrations using data from the Interagency Monitoring of {PROtected} Visual Environments ({IMPROVE}) program and the {IMPROVE} extinction coefficient (βext) equation to simulate an atmosphere dominated by smoke for sites in the arid intermountain western U.S. and great plains. This was accomplished by rearranging the βext equation to solve for organic mass as a function of {VR}. The results show that {PM}2.5 and {VR} are related by {PM}2.5 = 622 * {VR}−0.98 with a correlation of 0.99 and that at low {VR} values ({\textless}10 km) a small change in {VR} results in a large change in {PM}2.5 concentrations. The results also show that relative humidity and the presence of hygroscopic pollutants from sources other than fire can change the {VR}/{PM}2.5 relationships, especially at {PM}2.5 concentrations less than approximately 90 µg/m3. Implications: This work illustrates the limitations of current approaches linking {VR}, {PM}2.5 concentrations, and air quality health impact indices. It is the first published summary of known {VR}/{PM}2.5/health impact approaches nationally and internationally and the first application of the {IMPROVE} data and extinction coefficient equation to investigate these approaches scientifically for smoke-filled atmospheres. These {VR}/{PM}2.5/health impact indices are used to estimate {PM}2.5 concentrations when monitoring data are not available in order to inform the public during periods of wildfire smoke impacts. This work also offers discussion points to inform future work.},

	abstract = {Effects of climate warming on natural and human systems are becoming increasingly visible across the globe. For example, the shattering of past yearly records for global high temperatures seems to be a near-annual event, with the five hottest years since 1880 all occurring since 2005 (1). Not coincidentally, the single hottest year on record, 2015, also broke records for area burned by wildfire in the United States (Fig. 1 A and B ), eclipsing the previous high mark set just one decade prior (2). Scientists have known for some time that climate is a key driver of forest fires; records from the past and present (3⇓–5) provide strong evidence that warmer temperatures are associated with spikes in fire activity. Therefore, recent increases in wildfire activity as the planet warms are not a surprise. However, just how much of the recent increases in forest fire activity can be attributed to human-caused climate change vs. natural variability in climate? This question has profound scientific, management, and policy implications, yet answers have thus far remained elusive. In {PNAS}, Abatzoglou and Williams (6) present strong evidence that human-caused climate change is increasing wildfire activity across wide swaths of forested land in the western United States. They demonstrate that human-caused climate change has lengthened the annual fire season (i.e., the window of time each year with weather that is conducive to forest fires) and, since 1984, has doubled the cumulative area in the western United States that would have otherwise burned due to natural climate forcing alone. …

Increased {VLF} potential was projected across most historically fire-prone regions, with the largest absolute increase in the intermountain West and Northern California. Complementary to modelled increases in {VLF} potential were changes in the seasonality of atmospheric conditions conducive to {VLFs}, including an earlier onset across the southern {US} and more symmetric seasonal extension in the northern regions.

Results show that wildfire has negative and statistically significant effects on visitation in four of the five {NPs}. Aggregate annual visitation losses at each park are between 0.5\% and 1.5\% during a typical (mean) fire year. The negative regional economic impacts of seasonal wildfire at all national parks in Utah are estimated to be between \$2.7 and \$4.5 million, with an associated loss of between 31 and 53 jobs depending on the extent of area burned.

	abstract = {Climate change will alter opportunities and demand for outdoor recreation through altered winter weather conditions and season length, climate-driven changes in user preferences, and damage to recreational infrastructure, among other factors. To ensure that outdoor recreation remains sustainable in the face of these challenges, natural resource managers may need to adapt their recreation management. One of the major challenges of adapting recreation to climate change is translating broad concepts into specific, tangible actions. Using a combination of in-depth interviews of recreational managers and a review of peer-reviewed literature and government reports, we developed a synthesis of impacts, strategies, and approaches, and a tiered structure that organizes this information. Six broad climate adaptation strategies and 25 more specific approaches were identified and organized into a \&ldquo;recreation menu\&rdquo;. The recreation menu was tested with two national forests in the {US} in multi-day workshops designed to integrate these concepts into real-world projects that were at the beginning stages of the planning process. We found that the recreation menu was broad yet specific enough to be applied to recreation-focused projects with different objectives and climate change impacts. These strategies and approaches serve as stepping stones to enable natural resource and recreation managers to translate broad concepts into targeted and prescriptive actions for implementing adaptation.},

	abstract = {Air pollution is one of the greatest environmental health risks facing people worldwide. The transboundary nature of air pollution may place park and protected area ({PPA}) resources, as well as visitors, at risk of exposure to the same harmful pollutants that plague urban populations. Despite our knowledge of the various impacts of air pollution on endemic species, ecosystem functions, and human health, there exists a gap in our understanding of the affective, behavioral, and cognitive role of air pollution in the visitor experience in {PPAs}. We reduced this deficit by conducting a scoping review of existing empirical social science literature focused on the social and psychological effects of degraded air quality in and around {PPAs}. Using a systematic scoping process, we assessed peer-reviewed, empirical social science articles (n = 458), for evidence of human dimensions of air quality scholarship in International Union for Conservation of Nature ({IUCN}) protected area sites. Results suggest a relative dearth of peer-reviewed social science scholarship explicitly focused on the visitor experience of air quality in {PPAs} worldwide. Descriptive analyses illustrate a consolidation of scholarship in specific publications, as well as geographic concentration of scholarship in North American protected areas and {IUCN} Category {II} (National Parks). Subsequent inductive analyses yielded five emergent themes—ecosystem services, visitor impacts, transit, measurement of behavior, and variable importance—evident in human dimensions of air quality literature, as well as variety of implications for future human dimensions of air quality scholarship and {PPA} management.},
